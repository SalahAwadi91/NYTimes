# NYTimes 
 
 This task was resolved without any library in first,
 After that i knew that i can use libs, so i used these 
  - libs:
 *  RxJava , RxAndorid , ButterKnife , MaterialDialog , 
    Retrofit , Picasso , lottie , catloadinglibrary
 
 - compiled via JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8

 - Design pattern used: MVP
 
 - Parsing (Native parsing (will not work probably because the model has been changed after using Retrofit))
 - Parsing ( Gson: after working with Retrofit and Rx for connection)
 - Animation (lottie) json animation
 - Connection (Retrofit)
 - Binding (Retrofit)
 
 
 Regarding to Test unints: i didn't use any unit for testing or any type of testing, for two reasons 
  - i have no experince in unit testing , 
  - i wasted time on native coding before i know that i can use the libraries,
  - i read about the testing, but i think i have no time to implement it.
  
  * i didn't implement all variable in the model since it has unusefull data.
